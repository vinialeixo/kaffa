## SQL: List Orders with Number of Items

```sql
SELECT o.id AS order_id, COUNT(oi.id) AS total_items
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY o.id;


---

## Indexes:

On the Orders table:
- `client_id` (to speed up queries filtering by `client_id`).

On the Order_Items table:
- `order_id` (to speed up queries filtering by `order_id`).
- `product_id` (to speed up queries filtering by `product_id`).

On the Products table:
- `price` (if you frequently filter or sort by `price`).

On the Clients table:
- `email` (since itâ€™s unique and often used for lookups).
